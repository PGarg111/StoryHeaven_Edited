# StoryHaven_Edited

My project is a digital library called Story Haven. In this library the user will find popular books intended for middle and high schoolers. The website is divided using the different genres. To navigate the page you have to click on the different genres and then click on the book cover. Depending on whether the book is uploaded the user will see a page-not-found page or the actual book and be able to start reading. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create this website.

I updated the navbar and changed the table structures on all the pages to CSS grids with device compatibility. 

The features of the website include chapter buttons at the top and bottom of each reader page (after you clicked on the book cover). There are also buttons for the user to be able to increase/decrease the text size, play/pause music (it's relaxing piano music) while they read, toggle between dark/light theme, and return back to the main library if needed. When navigating through the buttons at the bottom of the page, the user will automatically be directed to the top of the next chapter. Before I used pure HTML for the books, but I found it easier to create JSON files and source them through HTML. 

The files I change are: A Pho Love Story, Foolish Hearts (partially), part of City Spies.
The files that have content, but are not updated in JSON: Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, The Downstairs Girl

The books the readers can't view have a lower opacity and there isn't a hover animation on them. The books the reader can view and read are at full opacity with a hover animation. 

The reader can see the whole series for the books which are part of a series on the genre pages.

My project was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with the help of Calibre for converting PDF to HTML.

Challenges I faced with this project was finding quicker ways to create JSON files. For some of the files I could create JSON files with ease and quicker (A Pho Love Story) and I though I could do that for the rest of the website eventually doing all of the files, but then I started on City Spies and figured out that things weren't always easy. With files that weren't in the right structure from the beginning were giving me a hard time. Eventually I did them partially to save time and focus on the other parts of the website. I added transition animation and a hover animation.
