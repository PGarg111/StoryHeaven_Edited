My project is a digital library called Story Haven. In this library the user will find popular books intended for middle and high schoolers. The website is divided using the different genres. To navigate the page you have to click on the different genres and then click on the book cover. Depending on whether the book is uploaded the user will see a page-not-found page or the actual book and be able to start reading. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create this website.

I updated the navbar and changed the table structures on all the pages to CSS grids with device compatibility. 

The features of the website include chapter buttons at the top and bottom of each reader page (after you clicked on the book cover). There are also buttons for the user to be able to increase/decrease the text size, play/pause music (it's relaxing piano music) while they read, toggle between dark/light theme, and return back to the main library if needed. When navigating through the buttons at the bottom of the page, the user will automatically be directed to the top of the next chapter. Before I used pure HTML for the books, but I found it easier to create JSON files and source them through HTML. 

The files I change are: A Pho Love Story, Foolish Hearts, part of City Spies.

The reader can see the whole series for the books which are part of a series on the genre pages.

My project was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with the help of Calibre for converting PDF to HTML.

My biggest challenges were with Javascript. Since it was my first time with Javascript, I went through a lot of tutorials, mostly on w3 schools. My biggest issue was that I couldn't write Javascript. I can look at Javascript and figure out what it's doing because of my knowledge with Python, but didn't know how to write. But learning Javascript and applying it to the website actually made my job easier. Before I was making a different page for each chapter, but with Javascript I was able to put all the chapters on one page and navigate using Javascript. The transfer of books into the website wasn't challenging at all, it was just time consuming, especially if the book converted wrong (I used Calibre for conversion).
